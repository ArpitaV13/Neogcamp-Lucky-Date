A fun app made for checking if your birthdate is a palindrome or not. ðŸ”¢

# How it works :

* This takes your birthdate and your lucky number as an input. ðŸ’¯
* Checks whether it is divisible by the sum of the digits of your birthdate. ðŸ•¥
* If it is divisible, then you are a lucky person and if not then you are an unlucky person. ðŸ©¹

Do share it with your friends too! ðŸ¤™
